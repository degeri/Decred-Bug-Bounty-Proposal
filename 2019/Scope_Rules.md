** Rules: **

    We prohibit DDOS or network bandwidth load testing.

    Unfortunately we are unable to pay for duplicate reports

    Public disclosure of the vulnerability without prior approval will make it ineligible for bounty.

    No social engineering.

    No spamming.

    All Current/Past (For up-to 6 months) decred developers are barred from taking part in this bug bounty program.

    Vulnerability reports made before the start of the program will not be eligible for a bounty.

** Reminders: **

    Almost all of decred's projects can be run locally and reproduction instruction are available on github. We strongly recommend you to do this.


    Use the testnet when possible.
